### **File Handling Guidelines**
- **Large Files**: Use offset/limit parameters for files >25k tokens (25,000 token read limit)
- **Audit Files**: Always read recent entries using `offset: -50` first to get latest status
- **Strategy**: Attempt full read first, then use offset on token limit failures
- **Best Practice**: For journals/logs, read from end using negative offset for most recent content

### Documentation Guidelines
- **please update documentation after every phase completion**
- **use clear, concise language**
- **include code examples where applicable**
- **focus on high-level architecture and design patterns**
- **ensure all new features are documented in the README**
- **use markdown formatting for readability**
