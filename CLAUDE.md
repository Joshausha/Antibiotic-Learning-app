# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm test` - Run all tests with Jest
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## Architecture Overview

This is a React 18.2.0 medical education application for learning about antibiotics, pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance. The app uses a tab-based navigation system with five main sections.

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **React Context API** for global state management (UserContext)
- **Custom hooks** for reusable logic (useUserProgress, useErrorHandler)
- **Component-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Webpack** build system with custom configuration
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (recently migrated from CDN to local)

### Key Architecture Components

#### State Management
- **UserContext** (`src/context/UserContext.js`) - Manages user progress, quizzes, and achievements
- **localStorage** - Persistent user data storage
- **useUserProgress** custom hook - Handles progress tracking and quiz state

#### Navigation System
- **Header** (`src/components/Header.js`) - Tab-based navigation with active state management
- **App** (`src/components/App.js`) - Main component that renders active tab content
- Five main tabs: Home, Conditions, Quiz, Pathogen Explorer, Antibiotic Explorer

#### Data Structure
Located in `/src/data/` - All medical data is stored as JavaScript modules:
- `medicalConditions.js` - 20 medical conditions across 10 categories
- `quizQuestions.js` - 79+ quiz questions with difficulty levels
- `SimplePathogenData.js` - **29 pathogens** (expanded from 10) with comprehensive clinical data
- `SimpleAntibioticData.js` - **30 antibiotics** (expanded from 15) with detailed pharmacological information
- `RBOMappingSystem.js` - **NEW**: Clinical guidelines mapping system linking 15 RBO conditions to educational content
- `pathogenAntibioticMap.js` - Cross-reference mapping system
- `quizQuestionsWithDifficulty.js` - Enhanced quiz data with difficulty classification
- `RBO_JSON` - Medical reference data (833 lines) - **FULLY INTEGRATED**

#### Error Handling Pattern
- **Error boundaries** with custom error handling
- **useErrorHandler** hook for consistent error management
- **Graceful fallbacks** for all major components

## Critical Development Patterns

### Data Flow
1. User actions trigger state changes in UserContext
2. Progress is persisted to localStorage
3. Components consume context state via useContext
4. Quiz state is managed through useUserProgress hook

### Component Organization
- **Feature-based components** in `/src/components/`
- **Reusable UI components** with consistent styling
- **Lazy loading** for performance optimization
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

### Testing Strategy
- **Jest** with React Testing Library
- **Integration tests** for major user flows
- **Component tests** for individual components
- Test files located in `/src/tests/`
