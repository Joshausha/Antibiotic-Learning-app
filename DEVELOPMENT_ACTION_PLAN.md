## 📋 **Daily Workflow**

### **Start of Each Day**
1. **Read PROJECT_STATUS.md** for current accurate status
2. **Run test suite** to verify no regressions
3. **Check dev server** to ensure build still works
4. **Review previous day's findings**

### **End of Each Day**  
1. **Update PROJECT_STATUS.md** with findings
2. **Document any new issues** discovered
3. **Commit working changes** (if any)
4. **Plan next day priorities** based on findings

### **Weekly Reviews**
- **Friday**: Assess week's progress against plan
- **Monday**: Adjust priorities based on findings
- **Update timeline** if major issues discovered

## ⚠️ **Risk Mitigation**

### **High-Risk Scenarios**
1. **Major architectural issues discovered**: Allocate extra week for refactoring
2. **Data integration fundamentally broken**: May need data layer redesign  
3. **Component dependencies missing**: Requires building missing pieces
4. **Performance issues with full dataset**: Optimization work needed

### **Contingency Plans**
- **If Week 1 reveals major issues**: Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks
- **If core features don't work**: Focus on making subset functional
- **If timeline pressure**: Reduce scope to working features only
