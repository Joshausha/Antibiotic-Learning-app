# Development Phase and Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 4 - Test Stabilization ⚠️

### What Was Accomplished
- **Monolithic Refactoring**: 635-line single file → 12 organized files
- **Component Architecture**: 5 focused components with single responsibilities
- **Code Quality**: 90% reduction in main component size
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance features implemented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc and README
- **Advanced Features**: Network visualization, drug interactions, comprehensive visualizations

## Current Test Status
- **Test Results**: 15 failed tests, 166 passed (91.7% pass rate)
- **Key Issues**: useLocalStorage hook tests failing, React act() warnings in Quiz Tab
- **Critical Needs**: Test stabilization required before production deployment

## Phase 4 Priorities (Current)

### 1. Test Suite Stabilization
- **Fix useLocalStorage Tests**: 6 failing tests related to localStorage mocking
- **Resolve React act() Warnings**: Quiz Tab async timing issues
- **Achieve 100% Test Pass Rate**: Goal for production readiness
- **Performance Test Fixes**: localStorage hook performance-related failures

### 2. Production Deployment Preparation
- **Test Suite Health**: Must achieve 100% pass rate
- **Bundle Optimization**: Currently at 68.86 kB gzipped (optimal)
- **Accessibility Polish**: Final WCAG compliance verification
- **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and fallbacks

## Future Roadmap (Post-Stabilization)

### 1. Additional Custom Hooks
- `useSearch.js` - Extract search logic from ConditionsTab
- `useQuizProgress.js` - Track quiz completion history and analytics

### 2. Advanced Features (Already Implemented)
- **User Progress Tracking**: Analytics and learning metrics ✅
- **Bookmarking System**: Save favorite conditions for later review ✅
- **Advanced Search**: Filters, sorting, category-based browsing ✅
- **Network Visualization**: Interactive pathogen relationship mapping ✅
- **Drug Interactions**: Comprehensive antibiotic analysis ✅

### 3. Data Integration
- **RBO_JSON Integration**: Expand content using existing RBO data files
- **Data Transformation**: Utilities for processing external medical data
- **Error Handling**: Robust data validation and error boundaries ✅

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **React.memo**: Optimize component re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for better performance ✅
- **Bundle Analysis**: Webpack bundle optimization ✅

## Feature Completion Status
- **Overall Completion**: 85-90% (test fixes needed)
- **UI/UX**: 95% complete
- **Core Features**: 90% complete
- **Test Suite**: 91.7% pass rate (needs improvement)
- **Production Readiness**: Pending test stabilization
