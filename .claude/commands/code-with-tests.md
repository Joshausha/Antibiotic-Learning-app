# Code With Tests Command

## Description
Implement features with comprehensive testing following medical education app standards.

## Usage
`/code-with-tests [task-description]`

## Prompt
You are implementing features for the Antibiotic Learning App, a React 18.2.0 medical education platform.

**THINK HARDER** - Consider all medical education implications and testing requirements.

Follow this development process:

1. **Pre-Development**:
   - Review current codebase patterns in src/
   - Check existing test coverage and patterns
   - Verify medical content accuracy requirements
   - Identify reusable components and hooks

2. **Implementation Standards**:
   - Follow React 18.2.0 best practices with functional components
   - Use existing UserContext and custom hooks pattern
   - Maintain Tailwind CSS styling consistency
   - Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Write TypeScript-style JSDoc comments
   - Follow existing file naming conventions
   - Use proper accessibility attributes
   - Implement responsive design patterns

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Write component tests with React Testing Library
   - Add integration tests for user workflows
   - Include medical content validation tests
   - Test error states and edge cases

5. **Medical Education Compliance**:
   - Validate medical terminology accuracy
   - Ensure evidence-based content
   - Add proper citations where applicable
   - Consider educational value and learning outcomes

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Monitor bundle size impact
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Ensure fast loading times

After implementation:
- Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
- Run `npm run build` to check bundle size
- Test manually for medical accuracy
- Document any new patterns or components

Remember: Medical education requires the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.
